# Welcome to the Aravoth Campaign Wiki!
Welcome to the wiki! Please use this as a tool to remain informed about the going-ons of the campaign along with anything you don't understand. Ask me anything you're confused about. There should be new articles frequently after a given session.

**Please refer to the following to understand how to use this wiki:**
## Navigation
In essence, there is one folder you should care about: "***ttrpgs***". Everything not in this folder you can safely ignore--mostly just assets. 
### ***Aravoth*** Folder
Within the ***Aravoth*** folder, there are two wiki pages and two folders. Of the wiki pages, *[[ttrpgs/Campaign 3/‎Home\|‎Home]]* is the current document you are on, and can safely be ignored. *[[ttrpgs/Campaign 3/‎World\|‎World]]* is the broadstroke explanation of the entire world, along with the "portal" for sessions and house rules. 
#### ***Notes***
Of the folders, ***Notes*** can be safely ignored--it is the folder with all the wiki pages accessible via the ***Aravoth Portals*** wiki pages. 
#### ***Aravoth Portals***
***Aravoth Portals*** is the main folder you should be using. There are multiple wiki pages here with links to every other wiki page, which should update constantly. If you go to *[[ttrpgs/Campaign 3/Aravoth Portals/Countries\|Countries]]*, for instance, you will find a list of every country with a short description. Upon clicking on the link, you will be sent to a larger wiki page within the ***Notes*** folder. 

There is a note that is especially important in the ***Aravoth Portals*** folder: *[[ttrpgs/Campaign 3/Aravoth Portals/Portal-Portal\|Portal-Portal]]*. The *[[ttrpgs/Campaign 3/Aravoth Portals/Portal-Portal\|Portal-Portal]]* is a portal of every portal in the wiki. It can be used to access the other portals in the ***Aravoth Portals***, if you wish.
## User Interface
As you can see on the wiki, there are many things you can interact with. The following will be an explanation of everything you can do on the wiki.
### Logo
The Pathfinder logo in the top left can be clicked to return to the [[ttrpgs/Campaign 3/‎Home\|‎Home]] page. 
### Theme
On the top left of the screen, right below the Pathfinder logo, there is a switch that can be clicked to change the website from dark to light mode. The default is dark mode. 
### Search
On the left side of the screen, there is a search bar. This search bar not only searches through the titles of notes, but also through the content of the notes themselves.

For example, if you were to search "*Dawnism*", it would list both the note titled [[ttrpgs/Campaign 3/Notes/Dawnism\|Dawnism]], along with every mention in the entire wiki, with context. 

This is an incredible tool you can use if you are confused with something. If I mention some term in a session you have not heard of, by just searching for the term you can find all information that your character would be aware of, at the drop of a hat. 

**I implore you to use this extensively during the campaign.**
### Navigation
This should be self-explanatory but just in case one of you (*cough cough Brody cough cough*) is confused, I'll explain. 

Below the search bar, there is a navigation menu. As mentioned earlier, ignore "***infobox***" and ***"assets"***. Click on "***ttrpgs***" to access the actual wiki. Then, you will have access to the [[ttrpgs/Campaign 3/‎Home\|‎Home]] page along with the [[ttrpgs/Campaign 3/‎World\|‎World]] page. If you click on "***Aravoth***", you will be given access to both the folder of raw notes ("***Notes***") and the folder of portals to the notes ("***Aravoth Portals***"). 
### The Wiki Page
A given wiki page has multiple components. At the top of the page is the title, which is then (usually) followed by an "Overview" heading. Under the "Overview" heading is basic information about the topic. 

Some articles also have an "infobox", which is something that usually has an image and some extra information about the specifics. Other articles just have an image. 

Afterwards, there will usually be multiple other headings followed by explanations. Sometimes, there will be a black bar which reads "*Main article: [[<insert article here>\|<insert article here>]]*", which refers to an article with more information on this specific topic within a topic.

Most wiki pages also have "backlinks", which is blue text that, when clicked, will direct you to another article. You can hover over these articles to scroll through, or you can just click on it to access the article. 
### "ON THIS PAGE"
On the right side of the screen there is a large area titled "ON THIS PAGE", which is a navigation menu within a page. It shows every heading and subheading, allowing you to rapidly navigate a given page to find exactly the information you desire!
### Interactive Graph
The Interactive Graph is a feature within Obsidian wikis that allow you to view the entirety of the wiki in the form of a graph. It doesn't really serve any purpose beyond looking cool, but feel free to use it for fun!

Within the graph, there are two options: Global Graph and Expand. Expand displays every article linked to in the page you are currently on. The Global Graph, however, shows you every page within the wiki and which links to whichever.

You can use the Global Graph to navigate the wiki if you would like, but I would suggest otherwise.
